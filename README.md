# Flix Finder

With all the streaming services we have today, we need a way to find which service is showing the movie or TV show we are wanting to watch.

Flix Finder allows a user to search for a movie or TV show name and returns all the streaming services it is streaming on. 
User can create a profile and save a movie or TV show as a favorite. 
These will be displayed on their profile.

# New Technologies Explored
* Redux: This is for state management. It stores the application's state in "Redux Store" and uses actions to call reducers to manipulate the state.

* GraphQL: This is a query language and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system to define for the data. GraphQL is not tied to any specific database or storage engine.

* BCrypt: This is a password hashing function.

* JSON Web Token: This is a standard used to create access tokens for an application. Server generates a token that certifies the user identity, and sends it to the client. The client will send the token back to the server for every subsequent request, so the server knows the request comes from a particular identity.

# Future Additions
* Ability to create Movie-Night events for planning.
* Include “Rent Movie for this much …” when applicable (Amazon Prime).
* Adding user streaming platform to easily find “Matches”.
* Branch out into niche movie-theatre events.
* Search results will go to detailed pages after clicking on name of any search result.
